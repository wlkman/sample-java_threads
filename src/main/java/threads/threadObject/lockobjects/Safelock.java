/**
 * Let's use Lock objects to solve the deadlock problem we saw in Liveness.
 * Alphonse and Gaston have trained themselves to notice when a friend is about to bow.
 * We model this improvement by requiring that our Friend objects must acquire locks for both participants before proceeding with the bow.
 * Here is the source code for the improved model, Safelock. To demonstrate the versatility of this idiom,
 * we assume that Alphonse and Gaston are so infatuated with their newfound ability to bow safely that they can't stop bowing to each other:
